<h2>BY ANDERSEN HORNE</h2>

<h1>The<br />
DAY OF THE DOG</h1>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Carol</span> stared glumly at the ship-to-shore transmitter.
"I hate being out here in the middle of
the Caribbean with no radio communication. Can't
you fix it?"</p>

<p>"This is a year for sun spots, and transmission
usually gets impossible
around dusk," Bill explained.
"It will be all
right in the morning.
If you want to listen
to the radio, you can
use the portable radio directional finder. That always
works."</p>

<p>"I want to catch the 5 o'clock news and hear the
latest on our satellite," Carol replied. She went to
the RDF and switched it on to the
standard broadcast channel. "Anyhow,
I'd feel better if we could put
out a signal. The way we're limping
along with water in our gas is no
fun. It will take us twenty hours to
get back to Nassau the way we're
losing RPM'S."</p>

<p>Bill Anderson looked at his
young, pretty wife and smiled.
"You're behaving like a tenderfoot.
We've plenty of gas, a good boat
and perfect weather. Tomorrow
morning I'll clean out our carburetors
and we'll pick up speed.
Meantime, we're about to enter one
of the prettiest harbors in the Bahamas,
throw over anchor ..."</p>

<p>The RDF drowned him out.</p>

<p>"The world is anxiously awaiting
return of the chamber from the
world's first manned satellite
launched by the United States ten
days ago. The world also awaits the
answers to two questions: Is there
any chance that Robert Joy, the
volunteer scientist who went up in
the satellite, is still living? There
seems to be little hope for his survival
since radio communication
from him stopped three days ago.
Timing mechanism for the ejection
of Joy are set for tonight. And that's
the second question. Will the satellite,
still in its orbit, eject the chamber
containing Joy? Will it eject the
chamber as scheduled, and will the
chamber arrive back at earth at the
designated place?</p>

<p>"There are many 'ifs' to this project
which is shrouded in secrecy.
The President himself has assured
us of a free flow of news once the
chamber has been recovered, and
this station will be standing by to
bring you a full report."</p>

<p>Carol switched the radio off. "Do
you think he's alive?" She suppressed
a shudder. "God! Think of
a human being up there in that
thing."</p>

<p>"Well, the dog lived for several
days. It was just a question of getting
it back, which the Russians
couldn't do. I don't know about
Joy. He sounded real cheerful and
healthy until his broadcasts
stopped." Bill peered into the fading
twilight. "Come on now, let's
put our minds to getting the hook
over!"</p>

<p>They concentrated on the tricky
entrance to the lee side of Little
Harbor Cay. It meant finding and
passing a treacherous coral head
north of the adjoining Frozen Cay.
Little Harbor Cay was midway in
the chain of the Berry Islands which
stretched to the north like beads in
a necklace.</p>

<p>"There's the cove," called Carol.
About a mile of coastline ahead was
the small native settlement. Once
the center of a thriving sponge industry,
the island was now practically
deserted. A handful of small
cottages, a pile of conch shells on
the beach and two fishing smacks
gave evidence of a remaining,
though sparse, population.</p>

<p>Dusk was rapidly approaching
and Carol strained her eyes against
the failing light. Bill heard her call
his name and saw her pointing&mdash;not
ahead to their anchorage, but
amidships and toward the sky. He
turned his eyes to where she was
indicating and saw a dullish object
in the sky, some thousand feet up.
The object seemed to be falling
leisurely towards earth.</p>

<p>"What in the world is that?"
asked Bill. "It's not a bird, that's
for sure."</p>

<p>The object seemed to be parachuting,
not falling. The breezes
were blowing it towards the island.
Before they could study it further,
it was lost in the lowering dusk and
darkness of the shore line.</p>

<p>"Looks like a ball on a parachute,"
Bill finally said. However,
the business at hand was to make
secure the <i>Seven Seas</i> and together
they spent the next quarter hour
anchoring.</p>

<p>After "setting the hook" securely,
Carol and Bill donned swim
suits, dove overboard and swam
lazily the 300 yards in to shore.</p>

<p>"Let's try to find that thing we
saw. It shouldn't be too far from
here," said Carol the moment they
hit the beach.</p>

<p>They climbed inland on the rocky
island. Little green lizards scooted
underfoot and vines scratched at
their ankles.</p>

<p>Bill was leading, when suddenly
he called, "Carol, I see something
up ahead! There's something lying
on the ground!" He hurried toward
what he had seen.</p>

<p>The dying sun reflected on a
luminescent bolt of cloth, somewhat
like a spun-aluminum fabric. Thin
wire lines were entangling it, and
about ten feet away lay three fragments
of what appeared to have
been a dull metal box.</p>

<p>Carol knelt at the closest piece,
evidently a corner of the box. It
was lined with wiring and tubes.</p>

<p>"It looks like electronic equipment,"
decided Carol, peering intently
at the strange piece. Bill had
approached the second and largest
fragment.</p>

<p>He carefully turned it over. It
was filled with black and yellow
... fur?</p>

<p>"Oh no!" he cried, knowing in
a flash, yet denying it in his mind
at the same time. Stunned, he stared
at the perky ears, the dull staring
and unseeing eyes, the leather
thongs that held the head and body
of a dog to the metal encasement.
Carol saw it the next instant.</p>

<p>"It's some horrible joke!" she
gasped. "It couldn't be the second
Russian satellite, it couldn't be
Muttnik! My God, no, it couldn't
be!"</p>

<p>Bill kept staring, his thoughts
racing. There were rumors of an
ejection chamber for Muttnik. But
they had been denied by the Russians.
But suppose the Russians <i>had</i>
planned an ejection chamber for
the dog Laika when they launched
the satellite and had only denied it
after they thought it had failed?</p>

<p>But if it <i>had</i> worked, why had it
taken so long to find its way to
earth? The satellite itself was supposed
to have disintegrated months
ago.</p>

<p>"Damn," thought Bill. "I wish I
were a scientist right now instead
of a know-nothing artist!"</p>

<p>He touched the dog with his toe.
It was perfectly preserved, as
though it had died just a few hours
before. It was rigid, but it had not
started to decompose.</p>

<p>"Carol, are we crazy? Is this
some dream, or do you believe we
are looking at the ejection chamber
of the Russian satellite?" he asked,
doubting even what he was saying.</p>

<p>"I don't know." Carol was wide-eyed.
"But what shall we do now?
We'd better contact the authorities
immediately!"</p>

<p>Bill tried to keep reason from
overcoming his disbelief of their
discovery.</p>

<p>"But how, Carol? Our radio
transmitter isn't working. It won't
till morning. And there's certainly
no other way to communicate with
anyone. We can't even take the boat
anywhere with the speed we're making.
We'll have to wait till morning."</p>

<p>"What shall we do with the
dog?" asked Carol. "Do you think
we ought to bury it?"</p>

<p>"Lord no, Carol. The body of
the dog will be extremely valuable
to science. We've got to get someone
here as quickly as possible." Bill
was trying to steady his nerves.</p>

<p>"Let's go back and try to raise
someone on the radio. Let's try
again, it may work," called Carol,
running in the direction of the boat.
Bill followed her. They stumbled
on the craggy rocks and exposed
sea grape roots, but together in the
darkness they struck out for the
boat.</p>

<p>Bill was first aboard and went directly
to the ship-to-shore radio.</p>

<p>"Try the Nassau marine operator
first," Carol panted as she clambered
aboard. "He's a lot closer to
us than Miami."</p>

<p>As the receiver warmed up, static
filled the cabin. Bill depressed the
transmitting button. "This is the
Yacht <i>Seven Seas</i> calling the Nassau
Marine operator," he called into
the phone. Only static answered.</p>

<p>"Bill!" Carol said in sudden inspiration.
"Give a May Day. Try
every channel with a May Day. If
anyone picks up a May Day call
you'll get emergency action."</p>

<p>"May Day, May Day! This is the
Yacht <i>Seven Seas</i>. Come in anyone!"
Bill called urgently into the
mouthpiece. He switched to the
Coast Guard channel, then to the
Miami Marine operators channel.
Only static filled the cabin. No welcome
voice acknowledged their distress
call. Bill flipped the switch
desperately to the two ship-to-ship
channels. "May Day! Come in any
boat!" Still static. Nothing but
static.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">It was</span> night. A night without
a moon. The island loomed dark
against the black waters. The dark
was relieved only by a small fire
burning at the native settlement a
half-mile down the coast, and the
cabin lights of the <i>Seven Seas</i>.</p>

<p>"What will we do now?" Carol
tried to sound unconcerned, but her
voice sounded thin and wavering.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we can do,
except wait until daybreak. I'm sure
we can get a signal out then," Bill
replied, calmly as he could. He
hoped she couldn't hear the pounding
of his heart.</p>

<p>"What about the dog?" she
asked. "Will it be all right there?
Should we bring it aboard?"</p>

<p>"We better leave everything untouched.
Our best bet is to get some
sleep and place our call as soon as
day breaks."</p>

<p>Neither of them could eat much
supper and after putting the dishes
away, they made up their bunks and
climbed in. After a very few minutes,
Bill handed a lighted cigarette
across the narrow chasm between
the bunks.</p>

<p>"I can't sleep. My head is spinning.
Do you really believe that's
what we've found?" Carol's voice
sounded small.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. I believe we've found
the Russian ejection unit, complete
with the dog Laika and instrumentation."</p>

<p>They lay quietly, the glow of two
cigarettes occasionally reflecting on
the bulkhead. Bill finally arose.</p>

<p>"I can't think of another thing
but what's sitting out there on Little
Harbor Cay!" He walked up to the
main cabin and switched on the
RDF. For a few minutes there was
music, and then:</p>

<p>"Flash! The United States Government
has just officially released
the news that at 10:09 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time the U. S. Satellite
ejection chamber was successfully
returned to earth at the designated
location. This was some six
hours earlier than expected. The
chamber, into which Robert Joy
voluntarily had himself strapped,
has landed at an undisclosed site
and is being raced under heavy
guard to the Walter Reed Hospital
at Washington, D. C. There is no
hope that Joy is still living. Word
has just been released by Dr. James
R. Killian that instruments measuring
Joy's pulse rate indicated
three days ago that all Joy's bodily
processes ceased to function at that
time. We repeat, all hope of the
survival of Robert Joy is now abandoned
as the result of scientific data
just released by Dr. Killian.</p>

<p>"The satellite is being brought
intact to Walter Reed Hospital and
leading physiologists and scientists
are racing to the scene to be on
hand for the opening of the unit
scheduled for 6 a.m. tomorrow
morning. Further reports will be
given as received. This station will
remain on the air all night. Stay
tuned for further developments. We
repeat, the U. S. satellite's ejection
chamber, containing the first human
being ever to go into space,
has been successfully returned to
earth as predicted, though all hope
has been abandoned for the survival
of Robert Joy, the man in the
moon. The chamber will be
opened for scientific study tomorrow
morning. Stay tuned for further
news."</p>

<p>Bill tuned down the music that
ensued and returned to his bunk.
"You heard that, Carol?" He knew
she wasn't asleep.</p>

<p>"Yes. And it makes this whole
thing that we've found seem more
plausible. I've been lying here trying
to make myself believe it's some
sort of dream, but it isn't. If we
could only ..." Carol's voice faded
softly into the night.</p>

<p>There was absolutely nothing
they could do. Nothing but lie there
and smoke and pretend to sleep.
They didn't talk much, and keenly
felt the terrible frustration of their
enforced silence on the ship-to-shore.
They heard several more
news reports and several analyses of
the news, but nothing new was
added throughout the night. The
radio only reiterated that the ejection
unit had been recovered, that
hope had faded for Joy's survival
and that the chamber was to be
opened in the morning as soon as
scientists had convened in Washington.</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">Dawn</span>, long in coming, broke
about 4:30. With the lifting of
the dark, the sun spots which interfered
with radio reception miraculously
lifted also. Bill and Carol sat
next to the ship-to-shore and turned
it on. This time they heard the reassuring
hum of the transmitter, not
drowned out by the awful static of
the night before. Bill switched to
the Coast Guard channel.</p>

<p>"May Day. May Day. This is the
<i>Seven Seas</i> calling the United States
Coast Guard. Come in please!"</p>

<p>And a voice, almost miraculously,
answered, "This is the U. S.
Coast Guard. Come in <i>Seven Seas</i>.
What is your position? Come in
<i>Seven Seas</i>."</p>

<p>"This is the yacht <i>Seven Seas</i>
back to the Coast Guard. We are
located at the Berry Islands at Little
Harbor Cay. We want to report the
discovery of what we believe to be
the second Russian satellite."</p>

<p>"This is the Coast Guard to the
<i>Seven Seas</i>. Do we read you correctly?
Are you reporting discovery
of the Russian satellite? Please clarify.
Over." A stern voice crackled
through the speaker.</p>

<p>"Last evening on entering the
harbor here we saw an object fall
to the ground. On inspection, it was
a metal box which was broken apart
on impact. In it are electronic
equipment and the body of a small
dog. Over." Bill tried to be calm
and succinct.</p>

<p>"Coast Guard to <i>Seven Seas</i>. Is
your boat in distress? Over."</p>

<p>"No, no! Did you read me about
the Russian satellite?" asked Bill,
impatience in his voice.</p>

<p>"Will you state your name and
address. Will you state the master's
full name, and the call letters and
registration of your craft. Over,"
crackled the voice from the speaker.</p>

<p>"Oh my lord, we're not going to
have red tape at a time like this,
are we?" Carol asked exasperatedly.</p>

<p>"This is Bill Anderson of Ft.
Lauderdale, owner and skipper.
Our call letters are William George
3176, Coast Guard registration
#235-46-5483. What are your instructions
regarding dog satellite?"</p>

<p>"Please stand by."</p>

<p>Bill and Carol stared at each
other while the voice on the radio
was silent.</p>

<p>"This is the United States Coast
Guard calling the yacht <i>Seven
Seas</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Seven Seas</i> standing by."</p>

<p>"We wish to remind you that it
is illegal and punishable by fine
and or imprisonment to issue false
reports to the Coast Guard. We are
investigating your report and wish
you to stand by."</p>

<p>"Investigating our report?" Bill
fairly shouted into the phone.
"Good God, man! The thing to investigate
is <i>here</i>, laying in three
pieces on the middle of Little Harbor
Cay. This is no joke." Despite
the emotion in Bill's voice, the answer
came back routine and cold,
"Please stand by. We will call you.
Do not, we repeat, do not make
further contact anywhere. Please
stand by. Coast Guard standing by
with the <i>Seven Seas</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Seven Seas</i> standing by," shouted
Bill, almost apoplectic, his face
reddening in anger.</p>

<p>"Now what? It looks like they're
going to take their time in believing
us. At least until they find out who
we are and if we're really here,"
said Carol.</p>

<p>Bill paced the deck in frustration.
Suddenly he decided, "Carol,
you stick with the radio. I'm going
ashore again and take another look
at our Muttnik. It seems so incredible
that I'm not even sure of what
I saw last night. Once they believe
us they'll want to know as much
about it as we can tell them." Bill
hurriedly put on his swim suit and
heard Carol shout as he dove overboard,
"Hurry back, Bill. I don't
like you leaving me here alone!"</p>

<p>Bill swam with sure even strokes
to the shore where they had gone
last night. The water felt cool. It
soothed his nerves which jangled in
the excitement of the discovery and
in the anger at the disbelieving authorities.
He reached shallow water
and waded towards shore.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped dead, his
ankles in five inches of water. His
eyes stared ahead in disbelief. His
brain was numbed. Only his eyes
were alive, staring, wide in horror.
Finally his brain pieced together
the image that his vision sent to it.
Pieced it together but made no
comprehension of it.</p>

<p>His brain told him that there was
a blanket of fur laying unevenly
twenty feet back from the shore
line. A blanket of yellow and black
fur ... covering the earth, covering
mangrove roots, fitted neatly around
the bent palm tree trunks, lying
over the rocks that had cut his feet
last night ... smothering, suffocating
... hugging the earth.</p>

<p>Bill shut his eyes, and still the
vision kept shooting to his brain.
All yellow and black and fuzzy,
with trees or a tall mangrove bush
or a sea grape vine sticking up here
and there.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and wanted
to run, for the scene was still there.
It hadn't disappeared as a nightmare
disappears when you wake up.
Thick yellow and black fur lay on
the ground like dirty snow. Covering
everything low, hugging the
base of taller things.</p>

<p>"Run!" his mind told him. Yet
he stood rooted to the spot, staring
at the carpet of fur near him. It was
only ten feet away. Ten feet? His
every muscle jumped. The lock that
had held his muscles and brain in
a tight vice gave loose and a flood
of realization hit him. "It's moving!"
he realized in horror. "It's
growing!"</p>

<hr />

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">As he watched</span>, slowly, slowly,
as the petals of a morning
glory unfold before the eye, the yellow
and black fur carpet stretched
itself in ever-increasing perimeter.</p>

<p>He saw it approach a rock near
the beach. The mind, when confronted
with a huge shock, somehow
concentrates itself on a small
detail. Perhaps it tries to absorb itself
in a small thing because the
whole thing is too great to comprehend
all at once. So with Bill's
mind. He saw the yellow and black
fur grow toward the rock. It seemed
to ooze around it and then up and
over the top of it. Bill saw, when it
reached the top of the rock, that it
dropped a spiny tendril to the
ground. Like a root, the tendril
buried itself into the earth below
the jutting rock, and slowly the rock
was covered with the flowing fur.</p>

<p>Bill's thoughts sped ahead of his
reason. The dog. The dog ...
growing like a plant. Its hide covering
the ground, putting out roots,
suffocating everything, smothering
everything, growing, growing.</p>

<p>With almost superhuman effort,
he turned his back on the awful
sight and swam desperately out to
the <i>Seven Seas</i>.</p>

<p>"Bill, what's happened?" cried
Carol, when she saw his white and
terrified face.</p>

<p>"Carol ... the dog ... it must
have had some cosmic reaction to
its cellular structure ... some cancerous
reaction ... when the chamber
broke open and the cells were
exposed to our atmosphere again
it started some action ... started to
grow ... doesn't stop growing ...
it's horrible ..." Bill's words were
disjointed and hysterical.</p>

<p>Carol stared at him. "Bill, <i>what</i>
are you saying?" Bill pointed mutely
to the shore. Carol rushed to the
cockpit. She stared at the island.
She ran back to the cabin where
Bill was sitting, holding his head
in his hands. She grabbed the binoculars
from the bookshelf and turned
them to the island.</p>

<p>"Bill! It's ... oh no! The whole
island looks as though it's covered
with ... fur!" She screamed.</p>

<p>Bill grabbed the binoculars and
ranged the island with them. A
quarter of a mile down he could
see small figures in the water,
floundering around, climbing
aboard the two fishing smacks. All
around, the black and yellow
mounds of fur carpeted the pretty
green island with a soft rug of yellow
and black.</p>

<p>"Get the Coast Guard, Carol!"</p>

<p>"They called back while you were
gone. They're sending a plane over
immediately."</p>

<p>"Call them, Carol!" Bill shouted
at her. "Don't you realize what this
could mean? Don't you realize that
something, only God knows what,
has happened to the cellular structure
of this animal, has turned it
into a voracious plant-like thing
that seems to grow and grow once
it hits our atmosphere? Don't you
realize that today they're going to
open that satellite, that other one,
in Washington? Suppose this is
what happens when living tissue is
exposed to cosmic rays or whatever
is up there. Don't you see what
could happen?" Bill was hoarse
from fright and shouting. "Smother
everything, grow and grow and
smother ..."</p>

<p>Carol was at the ship-to-shore.
"What time is it, Carol?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. 5:30 I guess."</p>

<p>"They plan to open the ejection
chamber at six. We've got to tell
them what happened here before
they open it! Hurry with the
damned Coast Guard!"</p>

<p>"May Day! May Day! Coast
Guard come in. This is the <i>Seven
Seas</i>. Come in and hurry!"</p>

<p>"Coast Guard to the <i>Seven Seas</i>.
Come in."</p>

<p>Bill grabbed the phone. "Listen
carefully," he said in a quiet determined
voice. "This is God's own
truth. I repeat: This is God's own
truth. The remains of the dog we
discovered last night have started to
grow. It is growing as we look at it.
It has covered the entire island as
far as we can see, with fur. Stinking
yellow and black fur. We've got to
get word to Washington before
they open up the satellite. The same
thing could happen there. Do you
understand? I must get in touch
with Washington. Immediately!"</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the urgency
and near-panic in Bill's voice.
The Coast Guard returned with
"We understand you <i>Seven Seas</i>.
We will clear a line directly to Dr.
Killian in Washington. Stand by."</p>

<p>With his hand shaking, Bill
turned on the standard broadcast
band of the portable RDF. A voice
cut in: "... latest reports from
Walter Reed General Hospital
where the first human-manned
satellite ejection chamber has just
been opened. All leading physiologists
and physicists were assembled
at the hospital by midnight last
night and plans to open the ejection
chamber at 6 a.m. this morning
were moved up. The chamber was
opened at 4 a.m. Eastern Standard
Time today. Our first report confirmed
that volunteer moon traveller,
the man in the moon, Robert
Joy, was no longer alive. Hope had
been abandoned for him some 80
hours previous, when recording instruments
on his body processes
indicated no reactions. Of scientific
curiosity is the fact that though
dead for more than three days, his
body is in a perfect state of preservation ...</p>

<p>"Flash! We interrupt this special
newscast for a late bulletin: The
body of Robert Joy has begun to
shoot out unexplained appendages,
like rapidly growing cancerous
growths. His integument appears to
be enlarging, growing away from
his body ..."</p>

<p>"Hello <i>Seven Seas</i>," broke in the
ship-to-shore. "We are still trying
to locate Dr. Killian...."</p>
